  Detailed Description :
  - Developed a secure and scalable Order Management System backend using Java 17 and Spring Boot with JWT-based authentication and RBAC.
  - Implemented clean layered architecture with separation of DTOs (entry, exit, update), entities, services, repositories, and exception handling.
  - Designed and integrated REST APIs for cart, product, user, and order management, supporting full CRUD operations with role-based authorization.
  - Utilized Spring Security and JWT to secure APIs, building a stateless authentication mechanism with custom filters and token utilities.
  - Created custom global exception handling with structured error responses, enhancing debuggability and maintainability.
  - Built scheduled services using Spring's `@Scheduled` to update product pricing dynamically.
  - Employed MapStruct for efficient, boilerplate-free mapping between DTOs and domain entities.
  - Followed best practices with Maven, modular packaging, and meaningful naming conventions for extensibility and testability.
